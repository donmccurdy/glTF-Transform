/**
 * # Extension
 *
 * *Base class for all Extensions.*
 *
 * Extensions enhance a glTF {@link Document} with additional features and schema, beyond the core
 * glTF specification. Common extensions may be imported from the `@gltf-transform/extensions`
 * package, or custom extensions may be created by extending this base class.
 *
 * An extension is added to a Document by calling {@link Document.createExtension} with the
 * extension constructor. The extension object may then be used to construct
 * {@link ExtensionProperty} instances, which are attached to properties throughout the Document
 * as prescribed by the extension itself.
 *
 * For more information on available extensions and their usage, see [Extensions](/extensions).
 *
 * Reference:
 * - [glTF â†’ Extensions](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/gltf/blob/main/specification/2.0/README.md#specifying-extensions)
 * - [glTF Extension Registry](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/gltf/blob/main/extensions)
