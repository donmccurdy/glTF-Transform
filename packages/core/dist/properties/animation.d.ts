/**
 * # Animation
 *
 * *Reusable collections of {@link AnimationChannel}s, together representing a discrete animation
 * clip.*
 *
 * One Animation represents one playable unit in an animation system. Each may contain channels
 * affecting multiple paths (`translation`, `rotation`, `scale`, or `weights`) on multiple
 * {@link Node}s. An Animation's channels must be played together, and do not have any meaning in
 * isolation.
 *
 * Multiple Animations _may_ be played together: for example, one character's _Walk_ animation
 * might play while another character's _Run_ animation plays. Or a single character might have
 * both an _Idle_ and a _Talk_ animation playing at the same time. However, glTF does not define
 * any particular relationship between top-level Animations, or any particular playback behavior
 * like looping or sequences of Animations. General-purpose viewers typically autoplay the first
 * animation and provide UI controls for choosing another. Game engines may have significantly
 * more advanced methods of playing and blending animations.
 *
 * For example, a very simple skinned {@link Mesh} might have two Animations, _Idle_ and _Walk_.
 * Each of those Animations might affect the rotations of two bones, _LegL_ and _LegR_, where the
 * keyframes for each target-path pair are stored in {@link AnimationChannel} instances. In  total,
 * this model would contain two Animations and Four {@link AnimationChannel}s.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const animation = doc.createAnimation('machineRun')
 * 	.addChannel(rotateCog1)
 * 	.addChannel(rotateCog2)
 * 	.addChannel(rotateCog3);
 * ```
