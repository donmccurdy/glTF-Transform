# Community

Resources and showcase for third-party projects using or extending glTF Transform. Submissions (by pull request â€” $TODO_LINK) are welcome.

## Extensions

Extensions enhance the glTF format with additional features and schema, beyond the core glTF specification. Many Khronos and multi-vendor extensions have official implementations provided by the [`@gltf-transform/extensions`](/extensions) package, but new extensions can be implemented by anyone, and installed with glTF Transform for custom content pipelines.
